# Valley Real Life (vrl.church) Redesign

## Overview
This is the redesign of the site for VRL. The theme should be friendly, inviting, and human focused. The content should be predominantly for the external guest looking for information about VRL and current activities. The site is built on top of RockRMS and will replace the theme previously developed by Pillars (now 9embers). This theme is not compatible with v16 and beyond of Rock. Specifically, the content components are broken.
